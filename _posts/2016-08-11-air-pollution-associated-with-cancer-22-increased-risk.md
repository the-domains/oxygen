Researchers at the University of Birmingham have found that long term exposure to air pollution can lead to certain types of Cancer.

The study focused on pollutants known to be caused by transportation and power generation and took place between 1998 and 2011 following over 65,000 people.

The headline here is that there is basically a 22% increased risk of dying from all types of cancer for every 10 microgram per cubic meter increase in pollutants from transportation and power generation.
