10 Tips to Protect Yourself from Unhealthy Air

Somebody once said "Convenient beats right, every time". It is human nature to avoid things we know we should do, just because it is inconvenient. That's why I really like the simple, effective and easy to follow tips to protect yourself and your family from unhealthy air (btw, I've only included 9 tips because the 10th would go against my "Convenience" point).

1. Check daily air pollution forecasts in your area. Download the American Lung Association's State of the Air app on your mobile device through the[Google Play Store][0] or the [iPhone iTunes][1] store. 
2. Avoid exercising outdoors when pollution levels are high. When the air is bad, walk indoors in a shopping mall or gym or use an exercise machine. Limit the amount of time your child spends playing outdoors if the air quality is unhealthy.
3. Always avoid exercising near high-traffic areas. Even when air quality forecasts are green, the vehicles on busy highways can create high pollution levels up to one-third mile away. [See why this is really important.][2]
4. Use less energy in your home. Generating electricity and other sources of energy creates air pollution. By reducing energy use, you can help improve air quality, curb greenhouse gas emissions, encourage energy independence and save money! 
5. Encourage your child's school to reduce school bus emissions. To keep exhaust levels down, schools should not allow school buses to idle outside of their buildings. 
6. Walk, bike or carpool. Combine trips. Use buses, subways, light rail systems, commuter trains or other alternatives to driving your car.
7. Don't burn wood or trash.Burning firewood and trash are among the major sources of particle pollution (soot) in many parts of the country.
8. Use hand-powered or electric lawn care equipment rather than gasoline-powered. Old two-stroke engines like lawnmowers and leaf or snow blowers often have no pollution control devices. They can pollute the air even more than cars, though engines sold since 2011 are cleaner.
9. Don't allow anyone to smoke indoors and support measures to make all public places tobacco free.
